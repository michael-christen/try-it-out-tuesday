Joey was getting some welding done nearby, so it was easy to pick out this
place. Unfortunately, the main venue was closed for renovation, but they had a
small popup in a grocery store next door. It was pretty good. We got some
tortilla chips with a sort of bean sauce and some chicken and ceviche tacos. It
didn't touch the Mission though.
