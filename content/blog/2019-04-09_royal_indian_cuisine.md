Joey's on a work trip and wasn't able to join us and won't be back for a couple
Try It Out Tuesdays, but plenty of friends made it out to this TIOT at Royal
Indian Cuisine. We all had a pretty great time with some:

* Crackers and Chutney
* Samosas
* Mild Butter Chicken
* Daal Saag or Saag Paneer, who's to say?
* Spicy Chicken Vindaloo
* Spicy Navaratna Korma
* Naan, Garlic Naan, and Onion Kulcha

The onion kulcha was a big hit. The Daal Saag was much fresher than we were
used to, probably from our experience with Saag Paneer which uses creamed
spinach.

We'd all love to come back soon!

Our good friend Clayton, who wasn't able to make it out to TIOT made an awesome
sound compilation of some past episodes that you should definitely check out:
