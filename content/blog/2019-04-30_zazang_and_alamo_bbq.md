## Joey @ Alamo BBQ

There's a lot to like about Richmond, but Alamo BBQ is at the top of my list.
Why? It checks all the boxes, from friendly people and historic location to
kick-ass food. I ordered the Texas Trainwreck—an Alamo signature—and enjoyed
every bite. As an added bonus, I washed it down with a homemade limeade.

## Mike @ Zazang Korean Noodles

No podcast from me folks, but super speedy service and a good time enjoying
some blackbean sauce over noodles along with some fried pot stickers with Ben.
