## Joey @ Federico's Mexican Food, Kingman, AZ

I didn't realize it was a chain until now...haha whoops.

In this special out-of-state installment, Joey and his coworker Geoff
think they're taking the road less traveled while eating at Federico's Mexican
Food in Kingman, Arizona. It was a roadside lunch filled with Tomato/Tomato
mixups, Tostadas, two too-tall Cokes and much much more.

## Mike @ The Crew

An interesting experience, we definitely should've gotten the beef bulgolgi
instead of the seafood pancake.
