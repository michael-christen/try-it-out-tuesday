## Joey @ Cookout, Laburnum Ave, Richmond, VA

What? You're in the Castro? Nope. I'm still in Richmond, and I couldn't resist
a trip to the legendary Cookout. This time around, I got the value tray and a
double-chocolate milkshake and I was very pleased. My co-workers? Not so much.
Oh well, where else can you get chicken nuggets as a side?

## Mike @ Cat Head's BBQ

This has been on my list for a while, but I haven't gone because they're closed
on Tuesday. So, we went on Wednesday and got some great BBQ with Mark, Ben,
Britt, Kaila, and Aaron.
